## About me
Hi! My name is Justyna Kowalska. I am a Certified Software Tester.
My longest experience is in testing web and desktop applications for the public sector. I also have a medical background due to my pharmaceutical education and previous work in a pharmacy.
I am oriented for further development as a Quality Assurance Specialist. 
On this page I would like to share the experience I have gained from self-study and previous projects.
I'm currently learning to write automated tests in Playwright using typescript.
